# JavaScript Style Guide

As a general rule we've come to appreciate and most of the style guidelines that Airbnb has established in their [JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

```javascript

Use single quotes `''` for strings:

// bad
var title = "Commander Space Cat";

// good
var title = 'Commander Space Cat';

```
